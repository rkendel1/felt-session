/// Sending used to be a WebSocket frame and nothing more: `sendDraft` cleared
/// the composer, echoed a bubble, and handed the frame to `OS1Socket.send`,
/// which drops it on the floor when the socket is gone. Offline — or, worse,
/// during the ~40s a backgrounded/wifi-switched socket still reads as
/// connected — that meant the message was simply gone: composer empty, bubble
/// showing, nothing delivered, and the next resync wiping the evidence.
///
/// So every send now lands here first, is written to disk before the composer
/// clears, and stays until the SERVER says it has it. Delivery goes over
/// `POST /api/sessions/:id/prompt` rather than the socket for one reason: it
/// answers. A WS `prompt` frame has no reply — the only hint of success is a
/// content-matched transcript echo a second later — and you cannot build "it
/// was really sent" on that. The reply also says WHERE the message landed
/// (started/steered/queued), which is better than the client's own guess at
/// whether a run was in flight.
///
/// Retries are safe because each item's `id` rides along as the request's
/// `clientId`: the server records the answer per id and replays it instead of
/// delivering twice (src/server/prompt-receipts.ts).
