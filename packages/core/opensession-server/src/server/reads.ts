/**
 * Per-user "last read" marks — the server mirror of the frontend's localStorage
 * read state (src/frontend/lib/reads.ts). Each user (the self-selected
 * `backstage-user` name from the UserPicker — not an auth identity) gets one
 * JSON file under `~/.opensession-reads/` of shape
 * `{ reads: Record<sessionId, isoTimestamp> }`, where the timestamp is the
 * session's `lastActivity` at the moment it was last open in the viewer.
 * Filename, directory resolution and legacy-name fallback come from
 * shared/user-store.ts, shared with pins and the other per-user stores.
 *
 * A session is unread when its current `lastActivity` is newer than its mark
 * (see isUnread). A session with no mark is never unread — the flag means "new
 * since you last read it", not "never seen" — matching the client semantics.
 *
 * The frontend pushes its full read map here whenever a mark changes (markRead
 * on open/activity, markUnread from the sidebar) so server-side consumers that
 * can't see localStorage — notably the hardware macropad feed (GET /api/keypad)
 * — can flag sessions with unread activity.
